<b>Coding assessment: </b> SwingUtilities.invokeLater was used instead of application.invokeLater <br>
In IntelliJ code base itâ€™s prohibited to use SwingUtilities#invokeLater, <br>
mainly because it could be too late to perform the runnable but there is no convenient API to check if that's the case (like the initial dialog is still shown, <br>
no progress window appeared since the activity was requested, etc.)
